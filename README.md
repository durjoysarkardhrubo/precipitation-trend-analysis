# Precipitation Trend Analysis

This repository contains the code and data for analyzing precipitation trends in the Faridpur Division using the Mann-Kendall Test and Sen's Slope Estimation. The analysis includes performing statistical tests on monthly precipitation data to detect trends and visualize the results.

## Contents

- `input.xlsx`: The Excel file containing the precipitation data.
- `python.py`: The Python script that performs the analysis.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Requirements

To run the code, you need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- openpyxl
- pymannkendall

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib openpyxl pymannkendall
```

## Running the Analysis

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/precipitation-trend-analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd precipitation-trend-analysis
```

3. Make sure the `input.xlsx` file is in the same directory as the `python.py` script.

4. Run the Python script:

```bash
python python.py
```

## Results

After running the script, the results of the Mann-Kendall Test and Sen's Slope Estimation will be printed to the console. Additionally, a plot showing the precipitation trend will be displayed.

## Example Output

The script will print the following information to the console:

- Column names in the Excel file
- Mann-Kendall Test result
- Sen's Slope Estimation result
- A plot of the precipitation data with a trend line
